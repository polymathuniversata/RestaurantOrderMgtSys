## 2. Challenges Faced

### Challenge 1: Order Status Workflow
**Issue**: Needed to implement a structured workflow for order status transitions to prevent invalid state changes.  
**Solution**: Created a validation system in OrderStatusUpdateSerializer that enforces valid status transitions (e.g., preventing "delivered" orders from changing to "preparing").

### Challenge 2: Permissions for Different User Types
**Issue**: Different users (restaurant owners vs. customers) needed different access levels to the same resources.  
**Solution**: Created custom permission classes (IsCustomerOrRestaurantOwner, IsRestaurantOwner) to manage access control based on user type and relationship to resources.

### Challenge 3: Order Total Calculation
**Issue**: Order totals needed to be calculated based on item quantities and prices, while handling changes to items after order creation.  
**Solution**: Implemented calculated property methods and overrode the save() method to automatically update order totals when items change.
